# Challenge 9

## Description:

Create a function called sum_powers(n, p), similar to challenge 1, that finds the sum of the first n natural numbers raised to the pth power; that is it returns the sum. Building on top of this, create a new function terms(big, p) that returns the number of terms (that is, n) that are needed for sum_powers(n, p) to be larger than big.
