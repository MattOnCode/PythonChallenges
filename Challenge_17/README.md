# Challenge 17

## Description:

The file trader.dat (in the Resources folder) contains a stock trader’s daily returns in pounds, one per line. Positive numbers represent a profit on the day and negative numbers a loss. The trader gets a bonus when her accumulated profit exceeds £400,000 (after which the counting starts again). The bonus is that day’s trading.


Write a program to find the ratio of the number of days on which she makes a profit to the number of days that she makes a loss. The program should also print the days on which the trader is awarded a bonus. It costs £100k per year to employ her (apart from the bonuses).

Write a program to calculate her employer’s average annual profit for 20000 days listed in trader.dat. Assume that there are 365 days in the year and she gets 28 days a year holiday, that so she trades on 5 × (365 − 28)/7 days per year.
