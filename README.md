# Python Challenges

## What is this?
This is a repository where I will be uploading the source code for various python challenges I do. This will start from challenges that are "beginner friendly" and end at the more "intermediate" level.

I have developed the solution for each challenge with three major factors in mind:
1. The solution must fulfill the requirements.
2. The solution should be efficient.
3. However, the solution should be beautiful and easy to maintain/understand.

Feel free to go through and try out each challenge for yourself and send me better solutions as issues.
