# Python Challenges

## What is this?
I will be dumping challenges to this repository as I learn the Python programming language in more depth. The challenges will be in ascending difficulty.
<br><br>
I will be developing solutions for each challenge with four major factors in mind:
1. The solution must fulfill the requirements.
2. The solution must be efficient.
3. The solution must be beautiful and easy to maintain/understand.
4. The solution must be reusable, so it can also be easily tested.
